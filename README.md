# flask-deployment
This code deploys a simple addition code using flask.

This is a very basic code to get the hang of Flask, in this code two numbers are inputted from the user and it's addition is projected as output on a html page.
I made this this when i was having issues with Flask,i had iddues with taking input from the forms,working a model on the inputs and give the required output.
So this simple code helped me to get a basic idea.I hope it helps you too!
